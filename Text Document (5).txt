CampusConnect – Student Activity & Volunteer Management Platform

❗ Problem Statement

In universities, information about clubs, sports, events, and volunteering opportunities is mostly shared through WhatsApp groups and social media. Because of this:

Students miss important events

No central place to see all activities

Hard for organizers to track participants

No proper reminder system

Volunteering records are not maintained

So students who want to be active often don’t know what’s happening or how to join.

💡 Proposed Solution

A web-based platform built using the MERN stack where:

All university non-academic activities are listed in one place

Students can discover, join, and track events

Organizers can post and manage activities

The system sends automatic reminders before events

Volunteering participation is recorded digitally

🧑‍🎓 Target Users

Students – Join clubs, events, sports & volunteering

Club/Event Organizers – Post and manage activities

Admin – Monitor platform and approve organizations
